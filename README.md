# GRE Playing
For me, the most difficult part in GRE is vocabularies!  
Currently my simple tool has two function:  
1. GRE.py  
2. review_mis.py

## Start Playing
1. clone the project  
```
git clone https://github.com/shinmao/GRE_Playing.git
cd GRE_Playing/
```
2. create the ```dict.txt``` in folder
```
vim dict.txt
```
3. 
```
```
